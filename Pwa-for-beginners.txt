  - PWA - Progressive Web APPs 
  - Build an App for all the devices such as tablet, mobile, desktop etc from one code base.
  - 'Progressive' means that the app developed will progressively enhance to match the different capabilities of these devices.

  - Device Specific Apps
    i)   These apps are developed in device specific languages.
    ii)  They are compiled and packaged as executables.
    iii) One code and executable per device.
    iv)  They get installed on device and can be distributed in app store.

  - PWA -
    i)   Developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    ii)  Hosted on web server.
    iii) Single code base and single hosted app.
    iv)  Can be installed or can be accessed via URL or search engine.
    v)   Can be distributed in app store.

  - PWAs are similar to websites in the sense that 
    i)   They have similar technologies, 
    ii)  They are linkable
    iii) Discoverable
    iv)  Safe
    v)   Can also have own icon 
    vi)  Own Window 
    vii) PWA has additional advanced capabilities such as 
          - sharing content with another apps 
          - offline functionality :- pwa can keep on functioning even if you are offline just like mobile apps.
          - can cache information for local storage
          - download things or movies for offline viewing
          - update data in background on regular basis
                    which is not possible for websites.

  - Progressive web apps are closing the gap between the native apps and the websites.
  - Web Assembly - Wasm
        i) Web assembly allows to run native modules like c++ code that can be compiled and can be run on the website or webapp with speed that is
           near to native apps.
        ii) Also progressive web apps have access to APIs to talk over bluetooth, USB or NFCs.

  - Progressive web apps has 3 layers of functionality

      Layer 3 -   Device          Os                  Offline
                  Adaptation      Integration         Support

      Layer 2 -   Manifest        Service-Worker      HTTPS

      Layer 1 -   HTML            CSS                 JavaScript

  - Websites can not be published directly on app store but the tool called pwmbuilder.com can be used to convert the websites into packages that
    can be installed on android or iOS

		2. Introduction to Service Workers
	-------------------------------------------------------------
  - Service Worker is a JavaScript file that is added to your app that makes your application reliable. 
  - They are the main brain behind the PWA app.
  - The typical web site has HTML homepage, called index.html, there you need to use a JavaScript function called 'navigator.serviceworker.register'
    which is used by browsers to load the service worker.
  - Usually, the websites are run as a single thread application, whereas service workers run in separate threads apart from website thread.
  - Service workers make it possible to run the application run in background.
  - Service workers are responsible for intercepting, modifying, and responding to the network requests by making use of two APIs
    i)  Fetch API
    ii) Catch API
  - It decides whether to send data from server or from the local cache when an application is requesting for the data.
  - Service worker should download enough information in the cache so that the application can display without any internet connection.
  - Typically, service workers download the HTML, CSS and JavaScript i.e. all static resources before hand using cache API and stores that into the cache
    so that it can display app at the start even without internet connection.
  - Service workers cache all the static resources.
  - If app needs any dynamic data such as latest messages that can also be stored in cache or indexDB.

  - summarized task list
    i)   Cache static resources 
    ii)  Redirect to custom offline page
    iii) More complicated offline scenarios
            - as service workers run parallel to the app or can run even app is not open, they can listen to the push messages from server and catch them
              and show notification on screen when they occur.
            - also service workers can do periodic updates. 
    iv)  Resources and Libraries

    3. Web Capabilities & Native Integrations
  -------------------------------------------------------------
    - PWA has two different capabilities, one that are coming from Web group as PWA are originally websites and second are PWA OS integration.
    A] Which web capabilities do PWAs have access to ?
        i)   Entire functionality of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is available for PWAs
        ii)  Media                   - text, images, movies, audio API (generate sound directly from browser), generate 2D/3D graphics using webgl/ Canvas.
        iii) Hardware                - bluetooth, USB, NFC (You can create an app that interfaces with other devices where your app is installed)
        iv)  web payment API         - allows your app to process payment requests
        v)   web authentication API  - authentication using windows hello or iOS fingerprint to log the user into your web app.

    B] How can PWAs integrate into the Operating System ?
        A great PWA begin with the great web experience but if you want to make the app feel more belongs to the device then you have to focus on OS integration.
            i)   Manage Files           - using file handlers
            ii)  File System access API - to store changes to the file
            iii) Sharing                - PWAs can actually interface with OS share dialogue which mean that they can share the content to/from other applications 
                                          and 
            iv)  Badges                 - PWAs can show Badge on the top of the app to get attention of the user within the app.
            v)   Ability to handle links and protocols.
