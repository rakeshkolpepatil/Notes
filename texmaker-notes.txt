   3) Difference between \section and \section*

      The brief answer is, \section inserts a new entry into the table of contents at the appropriate tree-level and also inserts a new entry into the navigation
      bars. But \section* only adds an entry in the navigation bars, not in the table of contents.

   5) \verb (or) \texttt

   	The short answer is you use \verb where you need to write a small piece of inline verbatim material that contains characters TeX treats (or rather, is 
      currently treating) as special. \texttt is for when you just want typewriter font.

   	\verb has some downsides, such as not working in moving arguments. In those cases, you're probably better off using \texttt (or related semantic markup)
      and performing the appropriate escaping.
