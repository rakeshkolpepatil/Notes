0) To start tracking files in a folder, first go to that folder directory and issue following commands,
   hg init             .hg 
   hg add <filenames>  Write the names of the files thoes which you want to track.
   hg status           This will show status of each file and whether mercurial is tracking that file or not. 	
   hg status --all     will list all the files in the tree, with a letter indicating its status: M for modified, C for clean (owned by hg),
		       and I for ignored.

   hg status -i     	   For just ignored files.
   hg status -a      	   For just added files.
   hg status --change 2    shows all the files that were changed in revision 2.

If you want to list only the files in a folder, you can provide a path

   hg sta -i <MyFolder>        – just ignored files in MyFolder.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
0.1) hg addremove
     this command will add the files which are not tracked currently by mercurial for tracking and remove missing files from being 
     tracked. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) hg log 
   It will list all the saved changesets in mercurial.

(OR) hg log -l 3
     It will display last 3 changesets.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2) hg log -r <arguments> e.g. hg log -r 1+5
   It will list the 1st and 5th changeset.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3) To go to a particular state of code defined by changeset 0.
 
     hg update -r 0
(OR) hg update REV

     It will restore software status to the changeset 0 or to changeset named 'REV'.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3.1) TO know changes made by a particular changeset

     hg diff -c REV

     View differences between two changesets for a given file.

     hg diff -r firstrevisionnumber:otherrevnumber filename

     e.g  hg diff -r 0:1 default.aspx

(OR) 

     If you explicitly want to know the difference between the current tip of the branch, and it's previous, you can use shortcuts.

     hg diff -r -1:. filename

     The -1 says previous changeset on this branch. the '.' means the current changeset. You can use -2, -3 etc, but once you hit
     a merge point, it gets a little more interesting.

(OR)

     hg diff

     Use this command to see what modifications you have done after the last commit.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4) hg status 
   It shows status of the files in the working directory i.e. whether they were modified or were clean depending upon options provided 
   like -c, -A, -M etc. 
   see "man hg" for more information.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) hg st -un | grep$ orig | xargs rm 
   To delete .orig files from directory.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6) hg resolve --all
   This command will open all the files that were not merged properly.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7) hg commit
   It will commit all the changes you made till now. Before commiting it will ask to type message to be associated with version of code.
   Type it as you are typing in vim editor.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.1) hg commit --amend

     If you commited the software then found out that there was some mistake in it, so after correcting that mistake donot go for one more 
     commit instead append those changes to last commit. It saves the un-necessary commits.
 
     The same command can be used to change the message associated with changeset.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.2) hg commit -A -m 'commit with addremove'
     This -A option will perform addremove operation before performing commit. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.3) hg cat a.txt        -To see currently what are the contents of a.txt file.
     hg cat -r 1 a.txt   -To see what were the contents of a.txt in changeset 1.
     type a.txt          -It is linux command to type the contents of the a.txt
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8) Cloning the Repository

   hg clone gpgpu-sim_distribution-master gpgpu_sim_temp_code_changes

   Now, If you are in "gpgpu-sim_distribution-master" directory and you want to make it's clone repository with "gpgpu_sim_temp_code_changes"
   then  use above command.

(OR)

   hg clone <local repo> <new repo> -r <revision> 

   This command is used to clone up to a certain revision only.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
9) Removing the changeset

 To remove a changeset that was already committed and pushed use :-

 	hg backout -r (changeset number)

 To remove a changeset that was committed but not pushed along with its descendants from the repository use (I think this is useful for me) :
 The hg backout command lets you “undo” the effects of an entire changeset in an automated fashion. Because Mercurial's history is immutable, 
 this command does not get rid of the changeset you want to undo. Instead, it creates a new changeset that reverses the effect of the 
 to-be-undone changeset.

(OR)    hg backout -r <changeset_number> --merge

	Give --merge option to backout command if you want to undo the effect of changeset other than last one. And it is adviced to use this
        option always for safety.

        To know more about backout command == http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/finding-and-fixing-mistakes.html


 	hg strip -r (changeset number)
(OR)    hg strip (hash tag)

 To remove the working directory's parent from the repository, but keep the changes from that changeset in the working directory:

	hg strip --keep .    
 The above command is useful to delete a particular changeset from the hg log.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
10)  
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
11) HASHES

    changeset:   5:938194ff430c

    hashes are useful when you want to tell somebody else about particular changeset because you can not talk in terms of changesets as they 
     Whenever you commit something Mercurial will record your name along with the commit so you have a record of who made each change.
    are locally unique.  

    When mercurial gives us information about changesets, it first tells us local changest number follwed by ':' and unique hash of that
    revision as identifier.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

12) Tags

  You can use a tag name anywhere you can use a revision number. If you have a tag named 1.0 that points to revision 30 you can use hg update
  1.0 and it will have the same effect as hg update 30.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

13) Setting the username:

     To specify your username, you’ll want to edit your ~/.hgrc file to contain something like this:

     [ui]
     username = steve Losh <steve@stevelosh.com>


14) setting of the mercurial are stored in .hgrc file in home directory.

    Here in this file you can specify the alias commands, or enable hg extentions like color, mq. Please read some document on hg extentions.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

15) hg glog

    When there are branches and merges in the code it becomes difficult to understand output of "hg log" command and here comes "hg glog"
    command for help.

    To make the log easier to understand, you can enable the graphlog extension by editing your ~/.hgrc file to contain:
	
	[extensions]
	graphlog =
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

15.1] hg annotate <filename>
      It shows changeset information for each line of a file.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

15.2] hg forget 

       Mark the specified files so they will no longer be tracked after the next commit.

       This only removes files from the current branch, not from the entire project history, and it does not delete them from the working directory.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

16) Branching with clones

     ************** Branching with Clones ***************

     The slowest, safest way to create a branch with Mercurial is to make a new clone of the repository. So if you are working on <test-project> 
     directory then go to it's parent directory and issue below command to create new folder named <test-project-feature-branch>.

     	$ hg clone <test-project> <test-project-feature-branch>
     eg.     $ hg clone gpgpu-sim gpgpu-sim-copy

     It is like having two copies of your project. To delete this branch is very easy just go to parent directory of both of these projects and 
     issue following command.

     	$ rm -rf <test-project-feature-branch>

     But if you find that these changes are useful and want to add to main branch, then issue "hg push" command in cloned branch, it will push 
     these changes to the default directory from which this folder was cloned. To see this default directory issue the command "hg path".

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

16.1) Branching with bookmark 

       website = https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/BookmarksExtension 

       Bookmarks are lables on changesets to help track line of development. They are unversioned and can be moved, renamed or deleted.
       Deleting a bookmark has no effect on associated changeset.
     
     $ cd <path_to_your_project>
     $ hg bookmark <branch_name1>
     $ hg bookmark <branch_name2>
     $ hg bookmark <branch_name3>

     	So here you have got two branches at the current changeset. Now you can switch between one of these branches by using command 
          hg update <branch_name1> 
     (OR) hg update <branch_name2>
     (OR) hg update <branch_name3>

          NOW when you are in first branch and issue commit command a new changeset is created and bookmark associated with that branch points 
     to this new changeset. Only one bookmark is active at a time.

     $ hg bookmarks   		 -To view the available bookmarks. 
     $ hg bookmark -d production 	 -It will delete the bookmark named production.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 16.2) Branching with Branch command 

     Branches are global and permanant, so if you want temperary branch go for bookmarks. 

     $ hg branch <production>     This will create the new branch named production just by renaming current working directory as "production". Now if you
                                  issue command "hg branches" you will see only one branch i.e. default branch. But after you issue a commit command in 
                                  this "production branch" hg will create new changeset and it's tag information will show it as a branch and now you will
                                  be able to see available branches i.e. 1] default and 2] production. You can switch between these available branches by 
                                  issuing commands given below. To see actual branching with "hg glog" command you need to issue single commit on each 
                                  branch.

     $ hg update <branch2>        This command is used to switch between the branches.
                                  "default" is the original branch.

       Commands to close a branch "branch2"

     $ hg update branch2
     $ hg commit --close-branch -m "This branch was not useful."
     $ hg update default 

       Now if you will not be able to see branch2 name in output of "hg branches" command.
     
     $ hg branches --closed       Issue this command to see the branches you have closed.  
     
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

16.1) hg outgoing

      show a list of changes that are waiting to be sent up to the central repository. These are the changes that hg push would send, if we 
      issue hg push. It shows the changes that are in current repository but not in central repository.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

17) COMMANDS ADDED BY ME IN ~/.hgrc:

	command to show coloured output of "hg log" command.	
	"show = hg log --color=always -pr" This part was added in the [alias] part of the ~/.hgrc file.
	so command "hg show rev" will be interpreted like this "hg log --color=always -pr rev"

	clog = glog --style compact 
        this command will give compact output of the glog command and can be used instead of glog
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

18) hg merge

         see this website for how to merge - http://hginit.com/02.html

     (OR)
          hg merge --tool kdiff3
          hg merge -t kdiff3
     
          You can use "--tool" or "-t" option to use mergetool of your choice.

     (OR)
          hg merge -r <REV>   Specify the revision <REV> to merge with.

     (OR)
          hg merge -P         Review revisions to be merged (no merge is performed).

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

19) hg parent 

    To know, on which changeset you are currently working issue this command.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

20) hg revert <filename>    It will discard the local changes to a file and restore it to a state, as it was at last commit. 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

21) hg update --clean .

    To undo the uncommited merge this command is used. Especially when you close the merge operation in the middle then use this command.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

21.1] Merging with kdiff

     The local copy i.e. B version will be from the current version of the software, while other version i.e. C file will be showing 
     target version of the software. This scenario happens while issuing "hg update -r <version_no>" command.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

22) Changeset Phases

    visit this website for more info :- https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Phases 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

23) ERROR 1:

     remote has heads on branch 'default' that are not known locally: 012fa24a0a5d
     abort: push creates new remote head 4a723eab87c3!
     (pull and merge or see "hg help push" for details about pushing new heads)

     	If you get follwing error while pushing the data on the server that means you and somebody else have made changes to the same file 
         taken from the same changeset and that other person has pushed his changes to the central repository. So you are getting this error.
         You need to first pull the changes from server, perform merge operation and then push the changes to the server.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

24) ERROR 2:

     rakesh@Rama:~/recipes$ hg commit --amend
     abort: cannot amend public changesets

     To convert the current commit from "public" to "draft" commit in order to allow amending, use

     hg phase --draft --force .
