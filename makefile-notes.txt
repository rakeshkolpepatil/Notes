_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     1]   To comment out a line in make file you need to preceed it with #.
          By default execution of make file will start from the first target but not with the targets whose name start with '.'
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     1.1] To tell make command ignore the erros and continue, compilation process use -i flag after make command.

          If you want to skip over the failed builds. That is if you are building many files and some of them threw errors 
          then in such cases compilation is aborted. so, if you use following command compilation will continue till end.

          make -i
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
     1.2]  This is very very useful utility -

           If you want to override a defination of a variable inside make file, specify that variable along with make call. Like this -

               sudo make CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/home/rakesh/cuda_4.2/cuda

           Here value of "CUDA_INSTALL_PATH" variable specified while calling make is used while compilation and all other values are ignored. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2] By default make file is named as "Makefile".
        The makefile often resides in the same directory as other source files and it can have any name you want. For instance, if your makefile is 
        called run.mk then to execute make command type:

        make -f run.mk

        -f option tells make command the makefile name that should be processed.

        There are also two special names that makes -f option not necessary:  makefile and Makefile. If you run make not passing a file name it will look 
        first for a file called  makefile. If that does not exist it will look for a file called Makefile. If you have two files in your directory one 
        called makefile and other called Makefile and type:

        make <enter>

        make command will process the file called makefile. In that case, you should use -f option if you want make command processes Makefile.

        Some options used along with make command --
        -C <dir>     --> this option when used along with make command means change to directory 'dir' before reading any of the make files or doing 
                         anything else.	 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.0] To specify particular version of gcc and g++ to use while doing make, using following options - 

          For example, to compile you driver, if gcc 4.6 is needed, you can do "CC=gcc-4.6 ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-xxxxxx.run"

          And when you compile the SDK, if you need gcc 4.4, just do "CC=gcc-4.4 make". I'm not sure, but you might also need CXX=g++-4.4 in addition.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.1] A make file consists of a set of targets, dependencies and rules. A target most of time is a file to be created/updated. target depends upon 
          a set of source files or even others targets described in Dependency List. Rules are the necessary commands to create the target file by using 
          Dependency List.

          target: dependency1 dependency2 dependency3
          <tab>   command1 i.e. rule1
          <tab>   command2 i.e. rule2

          Each command in the Rules, must be on lines that start with a TAB character. Space issue errors. Also, a space at end of the rule line may cause
          make issues an error message.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.2] Phony Targets, Macros and special characters

          sometimes a target does not mean a file but it might represent an action to be performed. When a target  is not related to a file it is called 
          phony target.
     eg.
          getobj:
     	mv obj/*.o .  2>/dev/null

          getobj target move all files with .o extension from obj directory to current directory. If there is no a single .o file in obj/ directory then 
          mv command will return error which is passed to make command. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.3] There is a special phony target called 'all' where you can group several main targets and phony targets. 'all' phony target  is often used to lead 
          make command while   
          reading makefile. 

          all: getobj app install putobj

          The make command will execute the targets in sequence: getobj, app, install and putobj. 

          Another interesting feature, make command supports is the concept of MACRO in makefiles. We can define a MACRO by writing:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.4] By default make file will print the commands to the console, before executing it. To avoid this you can do -

      	1) on a case-by-case basis, by adding @ at the beginning of the command.
     	2) globally, by adding the .SILENT built-in target.
     	3) somewhere along the make process, by invoking sub-make(s) with one of the flags -s, --silent or --quiet, as in $(MAKE) --silent -C someDir, 
     	   for example. From that moment on, command echoing is suppressed in the sub-make. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     2.5] Ignoring the errors while processing rules.
          By default make command will abort it's execution when some error is detected while processing rules. 
          Ex:- 
                getobj:
          	-mv obj/*.o .  2>/dev/null
               minus sign before rule tells make command to ignore the errors occured while processing rule.

               getobj:
          	-@mv obj/*.o .  2>/dev/null

               - Tells the make to ignore errors. 
               There is another special character: @ - Tells make not to print the command to standard output before executing.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     3] all: 
        install:
          are called as targets and are given as arguments while executing make file. e.g.- make all, make install etc.
          This ensures that only code of these targets and their dependencies is executed.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     4] If you want to write a command in make file, so that it is executed when make file is executed, you should give space of one tab before it.
          Ex:-

          all: filename.cpp header.cpp
          	gcc filename.cpp header.cpp 

          In above example "all:" is target, "gcc filename.cpp header.cpp" is command that we want to execute and it depends on two files filename.cpp and 
          header.cpp
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     5] What does 2>/dev/null mean…?

          The > operator redirects the output usually to a file but it can be to a device. You can also use >> to append.

          If you don't specify a number then the standard output stream is assumed but you can also redirect errors

          > file redirects stdout to file
          1> file redirects stdout to file
          2> file redirects stderr to file
          &> file redirects stdout and stderr to file

          /dev/null is the null device it takes any input you want and throws it away. It can be used to suppress any output.

          In short, it redirects stderr (fd 2) to the black hole (discard output of the command).

          Some more common use case

              command > /dev/null 2>&1 &          ---------->    run command in background, discard stdout and stderr

              command >> /path/to/log 2>&1 &      ---------->    run command and redirect stdout and stderr to log file
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     6] Suffix Rules

          .c.o:
              cc -c $<
     
          When make file contans this suffix rule and it is invoked by giving papameter like abc.o then this suffix rule is processed as if follwing target was
          defined in makefile.
     
          make -f <name_of_makefile> <name_of_target_file_that_you_want_to_create>
     
          abc.o: abc.c
              cc -c abc.c
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     7]  Special characters

         What is that $< defined in suffix rule? That means name of current dependency. In the case of .c.o suffix rule,  $< is replaced by xxxxx.c file 
         when rule is executed. There are others:

         $? 	list of dependencies changed more recently than current target.
         $@	name of current target.
         $<	name of current dependency.
         $*	name of current dependency without extension.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     8]  The include Directive
     
         http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html#Include

         The include directive tells the make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing. The directive
         is a line in the makefile that looks follows −

         include filenames...

         The file names can contain shell file name patterns. Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, but a tab is not allowed.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     9]  The override Directive
     
         If a variable has been set with a command argument, then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored. If you want to set the variable in
         the makefile even though it was set with a command argument, you can use an override directive, which is a line that looks follows−
     
         override variable = value
     
     (or)
     
         override variable := value
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     10]  Difference between = and :=(or ::=) and ?= in makefile.

          http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Flavors.html#Flavors
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     11]  $(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)

          You should see here the usage of the | pipe operator, defining an order only prerequisite. Meaning that the $(OBJDIR) target should be existent
          (instead of more recent) in order to build the current target. So if $(OBJDIR) is absent then it is first created and then S(OBJS) is created.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     12]  $(strip string)

         Removes leading and trailing whitespace from string and replaces each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a single space.
         Thus, ‘$(strip a b c )’ results in ‘a b c’. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     13] $(findstring find,in)

         Searches in for an occurrence of find. If it occurs, the value is find; otherwise, the value is empty. You can use this function in a conditional
         to test for the presence of a specific substring in a given string.

         $(findstring a,a b c)
         $(findstring a,b c)
         produce the values ‘a’ and ‘’ (the empty string), respectively

         $(filter pattern…,text)
         $(filter-out pattern…,text)
         $(sort list)
         $(word n,text)
         $(wordlist s,e,text)

     17]  Changing directory before doing anything

           $(MAKE) -C ./sample1/  clean
           $(MAKE) -C ./sample1/

          The first command is translated to "make -C ./sample1/  clean". It will change to directory ./sample1 before executing the clean target from 
          the default makefile of ./sample1 directory and again will return to current working directory after finishing the job.
     
          Next command will get translated to "make -C ./sample1/" it will initiate second instance of make file, change to the directory ./sample1 and 
          execute default makefile there.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     18]  $(MAKE) <target>

          This command will start new instance of the make command, it will print the message of entering into the directory, then execute rules of 
          specified target from makefile of that directory and again return to the present working directory.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     19]  filter function in make file

          How do you perform a logical OR using make's ifeq operator?  

          ifeq ($(GCC_MINOR), 4)
         	CFLAGS += -fno-strict-overflow
          endif
          ifeq ($(GCC_MINOR), 5)
         	CFLAGS += -fno-strict-overflow
          endif

     (soln)

          ifeq ($(GCC_MINOR),$(filter $(GCC_MINOR),4 5))

          	filter X, A B will return those of A,B that are equal X.

          A variation of this is

          	 ifneq (,$(filter $(GCC_MINOR),4 5))

          where a negative comparison against an empty string is used instead (filter will return en empty string if GCC_MINOR doesn't match the arguments)

          The downside to those methods is the arguments have to be single words.

     21]  "-o, -d, !, -n" these are the bash scripting options which are used in if condition of the makefile. Know more about them.

          http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html  

          EXPR1 -a EXPR2   -->   True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true.
          EXPR1 -o EXPR2   -->   True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true.
          -n String        -->   True if length of string is non-zero.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

     22]  makedepend

     	 makedepend -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)

          This is the utility which creates dependencies in makefile. It will go through all the files in $(SRCS) variable and read #include directives to
          find out dependencies. for more info man makedepend.
