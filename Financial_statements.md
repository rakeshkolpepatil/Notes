# `1. Balance Sheet`
- Oldest financial statement
- shows what a company owns, owes and its Net-worth.
- it is of specific point of time or date and not of a period
- snapshot of the company at specific time or date.
- Divided into two partners
  1. Assets 
  2. Equity and Liabilities

## Assets 
- Things of economic value held by the company
  E.g. Land, Plant, Machinery, raw material, brand, patents.
- Divided into two parts 

### i) Current Assets (Short Terms Assets)
- The assets that company will convert to cash or use up within one year.
- Types of current assets
  1. Cash and Cash equivalents
  2. Account Receivables
  3. Inventory
  4. Prepaid Expenses
  5. Short Term investments

### ii) Non Current Assets (Fixed Assets or Long Term Assets)
- Assets that company will continue to use for more than one year
- long term assets or fixed assets
- Types of Non-Current assets
  1. Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)
  
  2. Capital Work in Progress
  3. Intangible Assets (Brand, Licenses, Patents, Logo) e.g - Page Industries has license from Jockey
  4. Long Term Investments (Buying other company or long terms investment)
  5. Goodwill (Extra Valuation that companies get bcz of good will)
      1. Represents the excess value paid above the fair market value for an acquired company
      
      2. It reflects other company acquisitions by the company
      3. This value explains why one business might pay more for another. 
      4. Goodwill appears on the balance sheet under the 'Non-current assets' section and is not subject to depreciation but is tested annually for impairment
      5. Goodwill arises only when one company acquires another for a price higher than the fair market value of the acquired company's identifiable net assets. 
      6. It represents the premium paid for factors like brand reputation, customer loyalty, and synergies.
      7. In contrast, other intangible assets like patents, trademarks, and copyrights can be acquired independently.
  
  6. Deferred Tax assets (Advance payment of Tax)

## Equities and Liabilities

### `1. Equity` 
- Net-worth or book-value of the company
- Equity includes 
  1. **Equity share capital**  
      capital invested by shareholders
  
  2. **Other Equity**  
      - **Retained Earning**  
        Profits accumulated by company after paying dividend

- Different types of equities are as follow 

  1. **Common Stock**        
    The par value of issued common stock, including the number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding.
  
  2. **Preferred Stock**  
    The par value of issued preferred stock, including the number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding.
  
  3. **Paid-in Capital**  
    The amount of money paid for shares of stock above their stated par value, known as additional paid-in capital (APIC).
  
  4. **Retained Earnings**
    The cumulative net income not distributed to stockholders in the form of dividends.
  
  5. **Treasury Stock**  
    The number of shares that have been repurchased from investors by the company, which reduces total shareholders' equity.

### `2. Liabilities` 
- Debts or Financial obligations on the company that the company owes to other parties.

- There are two types of Liabilities

  1. Current Liabilities 
      - Liabilities that have to be paid within one year
      - Account payable
      - Short term loans
      - **Accrued Expenses** - Light bill, salary/bonus/travel allowances of employees

  ```
  Total Liabilities = current Liabilities + Non-current Liabilities
  ```

#### 1) Working Capital
- Capital that the company needs to operate on day to day basis
  
    ```
    Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
    ```

#### 2) Balance Sheet Equation
  ```
  Assets = Equity (Net Worth/Book Value) + Liabilities 
  
  Equity (Net worth/Book value) = Assets - Liabilities 
                                = (What company owns) - (what company owes)
  ```

#### 3) Balance Sheet helps in understanding
- Financial Position

# `2. Income Statement / Profit Loss Statement`
- **statement of profit and loss** (OR) **statement of operations** (OR) **profit loss statement**.
- Tells about profitability of the company over a period viz quarterly/Annual.
- Shows revenue and expenses of the company
  
  ```
  Revenue(Sales) - Expenses = Net Profit/Loss
  ```

###  Revenue
1. **Revenue from operations**  
  Generated by sale of main products/services

2. **Other Income**  
  Interest Income(if given on loan) or Investment Income(like share market investment, Foreign currency gains)

###  Expenses
1. **COGS (Cost Of Goods Sold/ Cost of Sales)**  
    - Manufacturing cost of goods. 
    - In case of IT companies cost of developing software is called as Cost of Sales.

2. Operating Expense
    1. **Employee Benefit Expense**
    2. **Depreciation and Amortization**
    
    3. **Inventory Expense**  
       For companies like trading companies like DMart
    
    4. **Others**  
      Advertizing and Digital Marketing etc

3. **Finance Cost**  
  Interest Expense

### Depreciation 
- Company spreads the cost of buying of a tangible asset, over its useful life.
- used for property, plant and equipment.

### Amortization
- Company spreads the cost of buying of an intangible asset over its useful life.
- like trademark, patent, licenses, softwares and brands.
- eg. annual gym membership for 5 years.

### Single Step Income Statement
- All expenses are shown together
- Indian companies make single step Income statements
- Profit Before Tax(PBT) = Total Revenue - Total Expenses i.e. (COGS + Operating Expenses + Finance Cost) 
- Net Profit/Loss = Profit Before Tax(PBT) - Tax 
- Total Revenue is also called as 'Top Line'
- Net Profit/Net Loss is also known as 'Bottom Line'

### Multi-step Income statement
- All expenses are shown separately and subtracted from revenue one by one
  
  ```text
  1. Gross Profit                     = Total Revenue - COGS  
  2. Earning/Profit Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)  
     (Or) Operating Profit            = Gross Profit - Operating Expense  
  3. Profit Before Tax (PBT)          = Operating Profit - Interest Expense  
  4. Net Profit                       = Profit Before Tax - Tax  
  ```

### Earning Per Share (EPS)
- Tells net profit made by the company per share over a period of time.
- The most important number in income statement for investors.
  
  ```
  EPS = Net Income/ Total Number of shares
  ```
- It is good if EPS is growing consistently

- **Basic EPS**  
  Some shares are excluded while calculating basic EPS.

- **Diluted EPS**  
  All shares of a company are considered while calculating diluted EPS.

- We should always consider `'Diluted EPS'` while analyzing a company.
- Income statement helps us in understanding **profitability** of a company, **Quality of business** and creditworthiness** of a company**.

# `3. Cash Flow Statement`
- Tells how company generates and uses the cash.
- Most important financial document for investor.
- Started in 1980CE. Balance Sheet is oldest, started in 1400 CE. Income statement started around 1600 to 1700 CE.

### 1. **Accrual Accounting**  
- In this type of accounting, transactions are recorded for revenue or profit immediately after sale of products even if company has not received any cash payment from the customers yet. Thus accrual accounting does not show actual cash status of the company.

### 2. **Cash Accounting**  
- In this type of accounting, transactions are recorded only when company receives the cash. Thus this type of accounting shows cash status of the company more accurately.

- In Income statement/ Profit Loss statement, accrual accounting method is used. Thus profit loss statement does not give accurate state of cash component of the company. So, to get more accurate picture of the cash status of the company, Cash Flow Statement was invented.
- Cash is bloodline of a business. It is required for supplier payments, employee salaries and Daily expenses.
- Cash flow is divided into three parts -
  1. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO)**
      - Cash flow generated by or used by core operating Activities. 
      - e.g.  
          - cash from FMCG products for a FMCG company. 
          - Cash from selling paints for Paint company. 
          - Cash from selling cars for a cars manufacturing company etc.

      - **Calculation of CFO**
        1. Start with profit before tax from income statement.
        2. Adding back all non cash expenses like depreciation and Amortization.
        3. Subtracting all non-core income
        4. Adding changes in working capital - current assets/ current Liabilities.
        5. Subtracting taxes.
        6. CFO must be equal to or greater than net income.

      - Usually, we should not invest in the companies where CFO is consistently less than net income for many consecutive years.
      - Netloss including non-controlling interests 
      
  2. Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI)
      - Cash flow generated by buying and selling of long term assets or investments.
      - CFI includes 
        1. Buying and selling of property, plant and equipment.
        2. Buying and selling of investments.
        3. Giving loans and getting repayments.
        4. Interest income
        5. Buying and selling of companies (Acquisitions)

      - Whenever company buys cash goes out of the company and whenever company sells cash comes to the company.

  3. Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF)
      - Cash flow from raising equity or debt funding. (+ve cashflow)
      - payment of interest or debt (-ve cashflow)
      - payment of lease Liabilities (-ve cashflow)
      - payment of dividends (-ve cashflow)
    
  - Net increase in cash or cash equivalents = CFO + CFI + CFF
  - Cash and Cash equivalents at the end of the year = Cash and Cash equivalents at the beginning of the year + Net increase in cash or cash eq.

### **Free Cash Flow**
1. It is real cash that can be taken out from the business after covering all the investment needs of the business.
2. It is a real profit from running a business.
    
    ``` 
    Free Cash Flow (FCF) = Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO) - Net Capex
                         = Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFO) - (Fixed Asset Purchase - Fixed Asset Sold)
    
    ``` 
  - e.g.  
    - If the company has purchased fixed assets of worth 50 crore and sold fixed assets of  worth 10 crore, then Net capital expenditure (Net Capex) of the company will be 40 crore. 
    - Now, if cash flow from operating activities of the company is 450 crore then free cash flow of the company will be -
      
      ```
      FCF = 450 - 10 = 440 Crore.
      ```

- Cash flow statements helps us understanding
  1. Actual cash flow generated by a business
  2. Debt servicing capacity of the company
  3. The validation of the profitability
  4. Free cash flow of the company i.e. real profit to the owners of the company

### Standalone Vs Consolidated Financial statements
- Some companies have subsidiary companies like TATA has Jaguar as subsidiary company.
- In this case TATA is known as parent company and Jaguar is known as subsidiary company.
- When financial statements are made considering only one business of the company or of its single subsidiary then those financial statements are known as standalone statements where as when financial statements are made considering businesses of all the subsidiary companies then those financial statements are known as Consolidated statements.
- All three financial statements can be either standalone or consolidated.
- We should always try to see consolidated financial statements because some subsidiaries might be profitable but overall parent company might be loss making.

# `4. Financial Statements Ratio Analysis`

## 4.1 Liquidity Ratios 
These ratios help us in analyzing short term debt repayment capacity of the company.
  
### 1. **Current Ratio** 
- Indicates ability of the company to pay short term liabilities from short term assets.
  
    ```
    Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current liabilities
    ```

- It should be greater than 1 but also should not be too high. If it is greater than 5 or 6 then it means that company is not utilizing it's assets properly.

### 2. **Quick Ratio** 
- Indicates ability to repay short term liabilities from short term assets after excluding inventory.
- This is used to check whether company will be able to pay it's short term liabilities in case if it is not able to sell it's inventory.
    ```
    Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current liabilities
    ```
- It should be greater than 1 but less than 2 or 2.5
- In case of IT companies, both current and quick ratios are same as there is no concept of inventory.

## 4.2 Profitability Ratios 
### 1. **Return on Equity (ROE)**
  - It indicates how much net profit is generated as a percentage of the shareholder equity.
    
      ```
      ROE = (Net Profit / Shareholder Equity) * 100  
      ```
  - It indicates the strength of the business of the company.
  - If ROE is consistently greater than 15% for consecutive years then the company is considered as good.
  - Higher the ROE better the company.

### 2. **Operating Profit margin (OPM)**
  - How much of % revenue is getting converted into operating profit.
    
      ```
      OPM = (Operating Profit/ Total Revenue) * 100
      ```
  
  - Higher is better
  - Consistent or increasing is better.

### 3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**
  - Indicates how much total profit is generated as a % of total number of assets.
    ```
    ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100
    ```
  - Greater than 10% is good
  - Higher is better
  - Consistent or increasing is better
  - As per Basant Maheswari - `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsgT8kxCzw8` 23 min 
    
    ```
    ROA = Leverage x ROE
    ```

### 4. **Net Profit margin (NPM)**
  - Indicates how much % of revenue is getting converted into the net profit.
    
    ```
    NPM = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100
    ```
  - Higher is better
  - Consistent or increasing is better

## 4.3 Efficiency Ratios 

### 1. **Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR)**
- It tells how many times the company sells its inventory over a specific period of time.
- If the inventory turnover ratio of a company is 5 over a year, it means that company sells it's inventory 5 times over an year.
    
    ```
    ITR = (Cost of Goods Sold as per income statement) / Average Inventory as per Balance sheet.
    ```

- Higher is better
- Consistent or increasing is better
- If ITR decreases that means company is selling less and less products year on year.

###   2. **Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio (FATR)**
- How much revenue company is generating on per unit of fixed assets.

    ```
        FATR = Total Revenue / Total Fixed Assets
                                                    Total Revenue - Income Statement
                                                    Total Fixed Assets - (BalanceSheet) 
    ```

- If FATR is 5 that means that company is making sale of 5 rupees for each asset of 1 rupee.
- Higher is better
- Consistent or increasing is better

  > ITR and FATR ratios are used to compare companies with their peer companies.

## 4.4  Leverage Ratios 
###  1. **Debt to Equity Ratio (ITR)**
- How much debt a company has on 1 rupee of shareholder equity

  ```
  D/E Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
  ```

- Less than 1 is good.

###  2. **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)**
- How easily company can pay its interest expense.
    
  ```
  ICR = (Operating Profit)/ Interest Expenses
  ```

- It tells us how many times is the operating profit of a company to the interest expense.
- If ICR is greater than 3 then the company is considered as financially strong.
- Higher the better.

  > Both these ratios give idea about long term debt on companies.

### Notes To Financial Statements
