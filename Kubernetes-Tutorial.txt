  - Kubernetes also known as 'K8s' as it has 8 characters between 'k' and 's'.

  - Helm - Package manager for Kubernetes.

  - Kubernetes is a open source container orchestration tool developed by Google. It helps to manage the containerized applications in different deployment components
    like physical machines, virtual machines or cloud.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  Why container orchestration tool ?

  - Currently, there is a trend from monolith applications to applications consisting of microservices. Containers are perfect host for independent for the small applications
    like these microservices. Applications now a days consist of thousands of containers. Managing these number of containers across different hosts using only scripts is very 
    difficult or impossible. Hence the need for container managing/orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  What features do container orchestration tools like Kubernetes offer ?

  - High availability or no downtime. Applications have very less/no downtime.
  - Scalability or high performance
  - Disaster recovery - backup and restore. Restore functionality offers container to run from latest state, after recovery.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

  Kubernetes components

    - Kubernetes has large number of components like Pod, Node, svc, c-m, rs, ing, deploy, Service, Ingress, Volumes, Secrets, ConfigMap, statefulSet, Deployment etc but you will 
      be working with only handful of these components.
    
    1) Node and Pod
      - Node is a physical server or machine. 
      - The smallest unit of Kubernetes is Pod.
      - It is an abstraction over Docker container. Pod creates a layer or running environment over Docker container. Kubernetes does this so that it doesn't have to deal directly
        with containers and it always want to deals with the Kubernetes layers.
        So, an application Pod can interact with the database pod with its own container.
      - Though we can run multiple application containers inside one pod, usually only one application is run per Pod.
      - Kubernetes offers virtual network.
      - In Kubernetes world, each pod and not the container gets its own IP address and pods can communicate amongst each other using these IP addresses. These Ip addresses are 
        internal IP addresses and are not public.
      - Pods in kubernetes are ephemeral i.e. they can die easily.
      - Whenever a Pod dies, a new Pod gets created in its place and a new IP address gets assigned to it. So, If you are communicating amongst Pods with the help of ip addresses
        it becomes difficult when an IP address changes each time a Pod gets recreated after a crash. To avoid this another component of kubernetes "Service" is used.

    2) Service and Ingress
      - Service is a permanent/static IP address that can be attached to each Pod.
      - So each Pod will have its own service.
      - lifecycle of Pod and Service are not connected to each other. So, even if Pod dies its service and IP address will stay.
      - If you want your application to be accessible through browser you need to create external service.
      - 'External service' opens communication from external sources.
      - The IP address of the 'external service' looks like this 'https://124.89.101.2:8080'. For test it might be Ok but we want to use domain name in production like 
        "https://my-app.com". so for domain mapping kubernetes has one component called "Ingress". The request first goes to the 'Ingress' and then to the 'service'.

    3) ConfigMap and Secrets

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5 :

  1) Control Plane Node Overview :-
    - brain behind all operations inside the cluster.
    - provides a running environment for the control plane agents that are responsible for the state of the Kubernetes cluster.
    - Users send requests to the control plane via CLI, Web UI Dashboard or APIs.
    - control plane should be running at all times at all costs.
    - Control plane node replicas are added to the cluster and are configured in High Availability (HA) mode for control Plane's fault tolerance.
    - For state persistance of Kubernetes cluster, all cluster configuration data is saved to a distributed key-value store.
    - Key-value store can be configured on control plane node called as 'stacked topology' or on its dedicated host called as 'External Topology'.
    - 'External Topology' tries to reduce the chances of data store loss by decoupling it from the other control plane agents.
    - In 'Stacked Topology' of key-value store, HA control plane node replicas ensure key-value store's resiliency.
    - In 'External Key-Value Store' topology, dedicated key-value store hosts have to be separately replicated for High Availability(HA). This introduces need for additional 
      hardware and operational costs.

  2) Contrl Plane Node components :-
    - A control plane node runs following essential control plane components and agents 
      i) API server :-
          - All administrative tasks are coordinated by the kube-apiserver
          - it is central control place component running on the control plane node.
          - Intercepts all the RESTfull calls from users, administrators, developers, operators and external agents, validates and processes them.
          - During processing API server reads kubernetes cluster's current state from the key-value store, and after call's execution, the resulting state of Kubernetes 
            cluster is saved to the key-value store for persistance.
          - The API server is the only control plane component to talk to the key-value store both to read from and to save kubernetes cluster state information.
          - It is highly configurable and customizable.
          - can be scaled horizontally.
          - also supports the addition of custom secondary API servers. This secondary API server transforms the primary API server into a proxy to all secondary, custom API
            servers, routing all incoming RESTful calls to them based on custom defined rules.            

      ii) Scheduler :-
          - kube-scheduler assigns new workload objects such as pods (pods encapsulate containers) to nodes typically worker nodes.
          - kube-scheduler takes decisions based on current kubernetes cluster state (obtained from key-value store via API server) and new workload object's requirements 
            (obtained via API server as object's configuration data).
          - The scheduler also takes into account Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, data locality, affinity, anti-affinity, taints, toleration, cluster topology, etc. 
            Once all the cluster data is available, the scheduling algorithm filters the nodes with predicates to isolate the possible node candidates which then are scored 
            with priorities in order to select the one node that satisfies all the requirements for hosting the new workload. 
            The outcome of the decision process is communicated back to the API Server, which then delegates the workload deployment with other control plane agents.
          - The scheduler is highly configurable and customizable through scheduling policies, plugins, and profiles.
          - Additional custom schedulers are also supported, in that case object's configuration data should include the name of the custom scheduler or else default scheduler
            is selected.
          - The scheduler is extremely important and complex in a multi-node Kubernetes cluster whereas in a single-node kubernetes cluster it is possibly used for learning and 
            development purpose.

      iii) Controller Managers
          - are components of the control plane node.
          - run controllers or operator processes to regulate the state of the Kubernetes cluster.
          - Controllers are watch-loop processes continuously running and comparing the cluster's desired state with its current state.
          - In case of the mismatch, corrective action is taken in the cluster until its current state matches the desired state.
          - The cube-controller-manager runs controllers or operators responsible to act when nodes become unavailable, to ensure container pod counts are as expected,
            to create endpoints, service accounts, and API access tokens.
          - The cloud-controller-manager runs controllers or operators responsible to interact with the underlying infrastructure of the cloud provider when nodes become unavailable,
            to manage storage volumes when provided by a cloud service, and to manage load balancing and routing.

      iv) Key-Value data Store
          - etcd is an open source project under 'Cloud Native Computing Foundation'.
          - 'etcd' is strongly consistent, distributed key-value data store used to persist a Kubernetes cluster's state.
          - New data is written to the data store only by appending to it, data is never replaced in data store. 
          - Obsolete data is compacted or shredded periodically to minimize the size of the data store.
          - Out of all the control place components, only the API server is able to communicate with the etcd data store.
          - etcd's CLI management tool - etcdctl - it provides snapshot save and restore capabilities which come in handy especially for a single etcd instance Kubernetes cluster,
            which is common in development and learning environments.
          - However, in state and production environments, it si extremely important to replicate the data stores in HA mode, for cluster configuration data resiliency.
          
          - Stacked etcd topology :-
                Some Kubernetes cluster bootstrapping tools, such as Kubeadm, by default, provision stacked etcd control plane nodes, where the data store runs alongside and shares 
              resources with the other control plane components on the same control plane node.
              - kuebadm HA supports stacked etcd topology.
          
          - External etcd topology :-
                For data store isolation from the control plane components, the bootstrapping process can be configured for an external etcd topology, where the data store is 
                provisioned on a dedicated separate host, thus reducing the chances of an etcd failure.

          - etcd is based on the Raft Consensus Algorithm which allows a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.
            At any given time, one of the nodes is a group leader.
          - leader/follower hierarchy is different from primary/secondary hierarchy, meaning that neither node is favored for the leader role and neither node outranks other nodes.
          - etcd is written in Go programming language.
          - Along with cluster state, etcd also stores configuration details such as subnets, ConfigMaps, Secrets etc.                 

  3) Worker Node Overview :-
    - Provides a running environment for client applications running as microservices through application containers.
    - The app containers are encapsulated inside pods and are controlled by cluster control plane agents running on the control plane node.
    - Pods are scheduled on worker nodes, where they find required compute, memory and storage resources to run, and networking to talk to each other 
      and the outside world.
    - Pod is the smallest scheduling work unit in kubernetes. It is a logical collection of one or more containers scheduled together.
    - This collection can be started, stopped, or rescheduled as a single unit of work.
    - Also, in a multi-worker kubernetes cluster, the network traffic between client users and the containerized applications deployed in Pods is 
      handled directly by the worker nodes, and is not routed through the control plane node.
    - A worker node has following components along with add-ons for DNS, observability components such as dashboards, cluster-level monitoring and 
      logging, and device plugins :-

      i) Container runtime :-
        - Although the kubernetes is described as a 'container orchestration engine', it lacks the capability to directly run and handle containers.
        - In order to manage a container's lifecycle, kubernetes requires a container runtime on the node where a Pod and its containers are to be scheduled.
        - A runtime is required on each node of a Kubernetes cluster, both control plane and worker.
        - It is recommended to run all the kubernetes control plane components as containers, hence the necessity of a runtime on the control plane nodes.
        - Kubernetes supports several container runtime such as :-
          a) CRI-O 
              A lightweight container runtime for Kubernetes that supports quay.io and Docker Hub image registries.

          b) containerd
              A simple, robust, and portable container runtime

          c) Docker engine
              A popular and complex container platform which uses Containerd as a container runtime.

          d) Mirantis container runtime
              Formerly known as Docker Enterprise Edition.

      ii) Node agent-kubelet :-
        - Kubelet is an agent running on each node including control plane and worker plane.
        - It communicates with control plane and receives Pod definitions from API server and interacts with container runtime to run containers 
          associated with the Pod.
        - It also monitors health and resources of Pods running the containers.
        - Kubelet connects with container runtime through the plugin based interface called as - Container Runtime Interface (CRI).
        - The CRI consists of protocol buffers, gRPC API, libraries and additional specification and tools.
        - In order to connect to interchangeable container runtimes, kubelet uses CRI Shim, an application that provides a clear abstraction layer 
          between kubelet and the container runtime.
        - CRI implements two services ImageService and RuntimeService. 
        - ImageService is responsible for image related operations whereas RuntimeService is responsible for all the Pod and container-related operations.
        
      iii) kubelet - CRI shims :-
        - Any container runtime that implements the CRI could be used by kubernetes to manage containers.
        - Shims are container runtime Interface (CRI) implementations, interfaces or adapters, specific to each container 
          runtime supported by Kubernetes.
        - Below are some of the examples of CRI shims :- 

        a) cri-containerd
          - cri-containerd allows containers to be directly created and managed with containerd at kubelet's request.

        b) CRI-O
          - CRI-O enables the use of any Open Container Initiative (OCI) compatible runtime with Kubernetes, such as runC.

        c) dockershim
          - Before Kubernetes release V1.24 the dockershim allowed containers to be created and managed by invoking the Docker 
            Engine and its internal runtime containerd.
          - Due to Docker Engine's popularity, this shim has been the default interface used by kubelet. 
          - However, starting with Kubernetes version v1.24 dockershim is no longer maintained by the kubernetes project and 
            it's specific code is removed from the kubelet node agent of Kubernetes.
          - As a result, Docker Inc. and Mirantis have agreed to introduce and maintain a replacement adapter cri-dockerd
            that will ensure that the Docker Engine will continue to be a container runtime option for Kubernetes, in 
            addition to the Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR).

      iv) Proxy - kube-proxy :-
        - The kube-proxy is the network agent which runs on each node, control plane and workers, and is responsible for dynamic updates and Maintenance 
          of all networking rules on the node. It abstracts the details of Pods networking and forwards connection requests to the containers in the pods.
        - The kube-proxy is responsible for TCP, UDP and SCTP stream forwarding or random forwarding across a set of Pod backends of an application, and
          it implements forwarding rules defined by users through service API objects.
        - The kube-proxy node agent operates in conjunction with the iptables of the node. 
        - Iptables is a firewall utility created for the Linux OS that can be managed by users through a CLI utility of the same name. 
        - The iptables utility is available for and preinstalled on many Linux distributions.

      v) Add-ons :-
        - Add-ons are cluster features and functionality not yet available in Kubernetes and therefore is implemented through 3rd party plugins and services.
          a) DNS :-
              - Cluster DNS is a DNS server required to assign DNS records to Kubernetes objects and resources.
          
          b) Dashboard :-
              - A general purpose web-based user interface for cluster management.

          c) Monitoring :- 
              - Collects cluster level container metrics and saves them to a central data store.

          d) Logging :-
              - Collects cluster level container logs and saves them to a central log store for Analysis.

          e) Device Plugins :-
              - For system hardware resources, such as GPU, FPGA, high-performance NIC, to be advertised by the Node to application pods.

  4) Networking Challenges 
    - To mimic tight coupling available in monolithic applications, decoupled microservice based applications rely heavily on networking.
    - In general, networking is not easy to understand and implement.
    - As a containerized microservices orchestrator Kubernetes needs to address a few distinct networking challenges :-

      i) Container-to-Container Communication inside Pods.

        - A container runtime creates an isolated network space for each container it starts by making use of the underlying host operating 
          system's kernel virtualization features.
        - On Linux, this isolated network space is referred to as a network namespace.
        - A network namespace can be shared across containers, or with the host operating system.
        - when a group of containers defined by a Pod is started, a special infrastructure Pause container is initialized by the Container 
          runtime for the sole purpose of creating a network namespace for the Pod.
        - All additional containers, created through user requests, running inside the Pod will share the Pause container's network namespace,
          so that they can all talk to each other via localhost.

      ii) Pod-to-Pod Communication on the same node and across cluster nodes     (AND)
      iii) Service-to-Pod Communication within the same namespace and across cluster namespaces.

        - In Kubernetes, Pods are scheduled on nodes in a nearly unpredictable fashion. 
        - Pods are expected to be able to communicate with all other Pods in the cluster, regardless of their host node, without 
          implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT).
        - Kubernetes treats Pods as VMs on a network, where each VM is equipped with a network interface, thus each Pod receiving a unique IP
          address.
        - This model is called "IP-per-Pod" and ensures Pod-to-Pod communication, just as VMs are able to communicate with each other on the same
          network.
        - Containers share the Pods network namespace and must coordinate ports assignment inside the Pod, all while being able to communicate with
          each other on localhost inside the Pod.
        - However, the containers are integrated with the overall kubernetes networking model through the use of Container Network Interface (CNI),
          supported by CNI Plugins.
        - CNI is a set of specifications and libraries which allow plugins to configure the networking for containers.
        - While there are few core plugins, most CNI plugins are 3rd-party software defined networking (SDN) solutions, implementing the kubernetes 
          networking model.
        - In addition to addressing the fundamental requirement of the networking model, some networking solutions offer support for Network polices.
        e.g. - Flannel, Weave, Calico, and Cilium are only a few of the SDN solutions available for Kubernetes clusters.
        - The container runtime offloads the IP assignment to CNI, which connects to the underlying configured plugin, such as Bridge, or MACvlan, 
          to get the IP address. Once the IP address is given by the respective plugin, CNI forwards it back to the requested container runtime.

      iv) External-to-service Communication for clients to access applications in a cluster.

        - A successfully deployed containerized application running in Pods inside a Kubernetes cluster may require accessibility from the outside
          world. 
        - Kubernetes enables external accessibility through services.
        - Services are complex encapsulations of network routing rule definitions stored in iptables on cluster nodes and implemented by kube-proxy
          agents.
        - By exposing services to the external world with the aid of kube-proxy, applications become accessible from outside the cluster over a virtual
          IP address and a dedicated port number.

CHAPTER 6 :- 

  1) Kubernetes Configuration
      Kubernetes can be installed using different cluster configurations. The major installation types are described below :-
  
      i) All-in-One Single-Node Installation :-
        - In this setup, all the control plane and worker components are installed and running on a single-node. While it is useful for learning, development, and testing,
          it is not recommended for production purposes.

      ii) Single-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation :-
        - In this setup, we have a single-control plane node running a stacked etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.

      iii) Single-Control Plane with Single-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation :-
        - In this setup, we have a single-control plane node with an external etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.

      iv) Multi-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation :-
        - In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured for High-Availability (HA), with each control plane node running a stacked etcd instance. 
        - The etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane.

      v) Multi-Control Plane with Multi-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
        - In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured in HA mode, with each control plane node paired with an external etcd instance. The external etcd instances 
          are also configured in an HA etcd cluster, and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane. This is the most advanced cluster configuration recommended 
          for production environments.

  2) Infrastructure for Kubernetes Installation :-
