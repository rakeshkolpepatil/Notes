## <span style="color: #1dd393"> What is Markup Language ? </span>


A markup language consists of a set of symbols or tags inserted into a text document to control its layout and presentation. These tags indicate how different parts of the document should be treated, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

Common Examples  

1. <span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) </span>  
  The most widely used markup language for creating web pages. It uses tags to define elements like headings (\<h1>), paragraphs (\<p>), and links (\<a>).

1. <span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold">  XML (Extensible Markup Language) </span>    
  A flexible markup language that allows users to define their own tags, making it suitable for various data representation needs.

1. <span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> LaTeX </span>  
  A markup language used primarily for typesetting documents that include complex mathematical equations and scientific notation.

1. <span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> Markdown </span>   
  A lightweight markup language designed for easy formatting of plain text, often used in documentation and web content creation.

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> What is Typesetting ? </span>
It is the process of arranging and preparing text and images for  printing or digital display. It involves organizing the layout of content to ensure that it is readable, legible, and visually appealing. 

<span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> Key Components </span>  

1. **Font Selection**  
  Choosing appropriate typefaces that fit the content's tone and purpose.

2. **Font Size**  
  Determining the size of text to ensure readability while maintaining visual appeal.

3. **Line Spacing (Leading)**  
  Adjusting the vertical space between lines of text to improve legibility.

4. **Kerning**  
  Modifying the space between individual characters to achieve a balanced appearance.

5. **Layout**  
  Organizing text and images on a page or screen in a logical and visually pleasing manner.

<span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> Importance </span>  
  Typesetting is crucial in various fields, including publishing, graphic design, and digital media. It ensures that written content is not only informative but also engaging and easy to navigate for readers.

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> what is difference between Tex and LaTex ? </span>
The name "TeX" comes from the Greek word τέχνη (tékhne), meaning "art" or "skill."  
TeX and LaTeX are both systems used for typesetting documents, but they differ significantly in their design, functionality, and ease of use. 

<span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold"> 1. TeX </span>  
  - **Origin**  
    TeX was developed by Donald Knuth in the late 1970s as a typesetting system aimed at producing high-quality books, particularly those containing complex mathematical content.

  - **Functionality**  
    TeX provides a low-level programming language for typesetting. Users write commands to control every aspect of the document's layout and formatting, which can be quite complex and requires a deep understanding of its syntax.

  - **Flexibility**  
    While TeX is highly flexible and powerful, it can be cumbersome for users who need to create structured documents quickly. It requires manual formatting for many elements like sections, tables, and figures.

<span style="color: #e1881c; font-weight: bold">2. LaTeX </span>  

  - **Origin**  
   LaTeX (short for "Lamport TeX") was created by Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s as a set of macros built on top of TeX to simplify its use.

  - **Functionality**  
    LaTeX abstracts away much of the complexity of TeX by providing higher-level commands that allow users to focus on content rather than formatting. For example, users can easily create sections with \section{Title} without needing to worry about the underlying layout specifics.

  - **Ease of Use**  
    LaTeX is designed to make document preparation easier and more efficient, especially for academic writing. It includes built-in support for bibliographies, cross-references, and various document structures, making it more user-friendly for those unfamiliar with typesetting.
  
  - **Community and Packages**  
    LaTeX has a large community and extensive package ecosystem that allows users to extend its functionality easily. This includes packages for specific formatting needs or additional features like graphics handling or complex tables.

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Book Sections </span>

Books typically consist of several distinct sections that serve different purposes. Here’s an overview of these sections, including a brief description of each:  

<span style="color: #e1881c">**A) Front Matter**  </span>

1. **Foreword**  
     - Written by someone other than the author, the foreword adds credibility to the book. It often discusses the author's qualifications and the significance of the book's subject.
     - To introduce the book and its author, providing context and endorsement from a respected figure in the field.

2. **Preface**  
    - This section is authored by the writer and details the background of the book. It may include reasons for writing, personal anecdotes, and acknowledgments.
    - To give readers insight into the author's motivations and experiences related to the writing process, setting the stage for what follows.

3. **Introduction**
    - The introduction outlines what the book will cover, providing a roadmap for readers. It may explain how to use the book effectively.
    - To prepare readers for the content and structure of the book, highlighting its relevance and importance.

4. **Table of Contents**
    - A list of chapters or sections in the book, usually organized by page number.
    - To help readers navigate through the book easily.

5. **Principal Text**  
    - This is where the main content of the book resides, divided into chapters or sections that     explore various topics in detail.

<span style="color: #e1881c"> **B) Back Matter** </span>

1. **Acknowledgments**

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> LaTeX Basic </span>

- Overview
  - Developed by "Leslie Lamport"
  - Document preparation system
  - An alternative to text editing software, It is Free software
  - License: LaTeX Project Public License
  - Website: https://www.latex-project.org/

- What is different  
  - It is not WYSIWYG
  - Concentrate on content and not formatting.
  - Write simple commands for formatting.
  - Write content and complex mathematical formulae with ease

- Latex can be used for 
  - Write articles, books, scientific journals, and papers
  - Design posters, banners, resume, etc.
  - Mostly used by writers and engineers 

## <span style="color: #1dd393">  In Latex, what is difference between the curly brackets and the square brackets ?  </span>
  In LaTeX, the use of curly brackets {} and square brackets [] serves different purposes, particularly in the context of commands and document structure.

  <span style="color: #e1881c"> **Curly Brackets {}** </span>  
  
  **Purpose:**     
  Curly brackets are primarily used to group content and define the scope of commands. They indicate which text or elements a command should affect.  

  **Usage Example:**  
  For instance, in the command \textbf{Bold Text}, the curly brackets specify that only "Bold Text" should be bolded. If you write \textbf Bold Text, LaTeX will not understand which part to format, leading to incorrect rendering.

  **Additional Functionality:**  
   Curly brackets are also used when creating sets in mathematics (e.g., {x, y, z}) or when defining environments that require specific parameters.

  <span style="color: #e1881c"> **Square Brackets []**  </span>  
  **Purpose:**  
  Square brackets are typically used to provide optional arguments to commands or environments. They allow users to customize certain aspects of a command without affecting the main content.
  
  **Usage Example:**  
   In the command ```\documentclass[a4paper]{article}```, the square brackets specify optional parameters (in this case, the paper size) for the ```\documentclass``` command. The main class type (article) is still defined within curly brackets.

  **Additional Functionality:**  
  Square brackets can also be used in mathematical expressions to denote intervals or lists.

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Latex Syntax </span>
- Following is syntax for Latex 

    ```tex 
    \documentclass{article}                     % Specifies type of the document for eg. article, book, report.
    \title{Creating first document in \LaTeX}   % Title of the document
    \author{Rakesh}                             % Author of the document
    \date{\today}                               % Date when the document was created, can be hardcoded or set to today. 
    
    \begin{document}
      \maketitle                                % This command will display title and author details. 
      \tableofcontents                          % Creates table of contents. This command should be after \maketitle. 
                                                % Need to compile the .tex doc two times for this to work.
      content
    \end{document}                              % To write content of the document

    \LaTeX                                      % Prints LaTeX Symbol

    % This is comment                           % Comments begin with '%' symbol.

    \\                                          % Next line character

    \paragraph{First Paragraph}                 % Will create a paragraph i.e. indent next line. 
                                                % Curly brackets enclose title of the paragraph which is optional.

    \paragraph[Intro]{First Paragraph}          % You can specify short name inside square bracket for a paragraph. 
    ```

- Files associated with LaTeX 
  ```
    .tex                      # This is the file in which we write
    .pdf                      # This is the final file that gets generated.
    .aux & .log               # These are intermediate files that get generated while building the .tex files.   
  ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Sections in LaTeX </span>
- Section Levels  

  ```
  -1. \part{...}      : article, report, book
  1.  \chapter{...}   : report, book
  2.  \section{..
  3.  \subsection{...}
  4.  \subsubsection{...}
  5.  \paragraph{...}
  5.  \subparagraph{...}
  Note: 1 to 5 in all document classes
  ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Multiline Comments in LaTeX </span>

1. **Using Percent Symbols %**  
  The simplest way to create multi-line comments is to place a percent symbol % at the beginning of each line you want to comment out.  
  For example:
    ```tex
    \documentclass{article}

    \begin{document}

    % This is a comment line.
    % This is another comment line.
    % Each line must start with a %.

    This text will appear in the document.

    \end{document}
    ```

2. **Using the comment Package**  
  For larger sections of comments, you can use the comment package, which allows you to define a block of text that will be ignored during compilation.   
  First, include the package in your preamble: ``` \usepackage{comment} ```. Then, use the comment environment to encapsulate your comments:

    ```tex
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{comment}

    \begin{document}

    \begin{comment}
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span several lines without needing to use %
    at the beginning of each line.
    \end{comment}

    This text will appear in the document.
    \end{document}
    ```

3. **Using Conditional Statements**  
  Another method for creating multi-line comments is by using conditional statements like ```\iffalse and \fi```. 
  Text between these commands will be ignored:

    ```tex
    \documentclass{article}

    \begin{document}

    \iffalse
    This text will not appear in the document.
    It can also span multiple lines.
    \fi

    This text will appear in the document.

    \end{document}
    ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Using Packages </span>
- Packages are  
  - File containing extra LATEX commands
  - .sty file
  - contains Styling, new features
  - \usepackage[Parameters] {PackageName}

    3. headings  :  \pagestyle{headings} Will display page number at the top of the page. 
    ```
  
    ```tex 
    \pagestyle{<style>}        % Apply page numbering style to all the pages in entire document 
    \thispagestyle{<style>}    % Apply page numbering style to the current page 
    ```

- Page Numbering Style
  ```tex
  \pagenumbering{arabic}   % 1, 2, 3, ...

  \pagenumbering{alph}     % a, b, c, ..
  \pagenumbering{Alph}     % A,B, C,...
  ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Page Orientation, Page Break and Footnotes </span>

- Direction of the document, Portrait(Vertical) Landscape(Horizontal)
- Footnotes give more information about the content and are written at the bottom of the page.
  ```tex

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Errors while building LaTeX </span>
- While building .tex files, often error message are displayed if any of the following issue arises -
  1. Missing or mismatch in curly brace
  2. Environment not ended
  3. Package not included
  4. Style file not found 

- Error messages have following structure -
  ```
  ! <Error message>
  l. <Line number>
  ```

- It is advisable to compile the document frequently to catch the errors early. 
- Also, you can make use of ```\end{document}``` to reduce the size of the document temporarily and catch the compiler errors from smaller code section.

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Formating Text </span>

- Setting up the font for entire document.
  ```tex

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Cross Referencing </span>
  - cross referencing is referencing the certain part within the same document.
  - Following are the best practices for defining labels 

    | KEY            | Shortcut For   |
    |----------------|----------------| 
    | **ch**         | chapter        | 
    | **sec**        | section        |
    | **subsec**     | subsection     |
    | **fig**        | figure         |
    | **tbl**        | table          |

    ```tex
    \label{KEY}       % Create a reference using 'KEY'

    \ref{KEY}         % \ref creates a reference with the section/subsection 
                      % number in which that label was defined.  

    \pageref{KEY}     % \pageref creates reference with page number. 
    \nameref{KEY}     % \nameref creates a reference with the name of the section. 
    ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Creating Indexes </span>
  - An Index contains a list of words and their page numbers to make readers easier to refer the words.
    ```tex
    \usepackage{imakeidx}
    \makeindex                      % Add this in preamble of the document i.e. before \begin{document}
    \makeindex[columns=X]           % X denotes the number of columns for arranging the indices.
    \makeindex[title=Back Index]    % Setting up title for the Index Page.
    \makeindex[intoc]               % Index Title and its page number will be shown in Table of Contents.

    \index{KEY}                     % Create index keys (Words). KEY should be the word to be indexed.
    \index{ParentKEY!KEY}           % Subentry in index.
    \index{KEY|see{OtherKEY}}       % Cross referencing a key.
    \printindex                     % Display the indices (at the end of the document)
                                    % Should be just before the '\end{document}' command. 
    ```

## <span style="color: #1dd393"> Creating Bibliography </span>
  - Bibliography is used to attribute the documents referenced in the research paper, journals, books, 
    articles etc.
  - You need to create bib file and cite it in the document.
  - In order to compile the bibliography, you need to compile the '.tex' file with 'latexmk' compiler.
  - Syntax of .bib file
    ```tex
    @inproceedings{KEY,
      title={},
      author={},
      booktitle={},
      pages={X--Y},
      year={},
      organization={}
    }
    @article{KEY,
      title={},
      author={},
      journal={},
      volume={},
      number={},
      pages={X--Y},
      year={},
      publisher={}
    }
    @book{KEY,
      title={},
      author={},
      volume={},
      year={},
      publisher={}
      location={},
    }
    ``` 

  - Sample .bib file
    ```tex
    @BOOK{doe2024,
      AUTHOR = {John Doe},
      TITLE = {The Book without Title},
      PUBLISHER = {Dummy Publisher},
      YEAR = {2024},
    }

    @ARTICLE{einstein1905,
      AUTHOR = {Albert Einstein},
      TITLE = {On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies},
      JOURNAL = {Annalen der Physik},
      VOLUME = {322},
      NUMBER = {10},
      PAGES = {891-921},
      YEAR = {1905},
    }
    ```

  - Cite in .tex files 
    ```
    \cite{KEY}                    % Cite the reference in .tex file.
    \bibliographystyle{Style}     % Styles - plain, alpha, unsrt, acm 
    \bibliography{filename.bib}   % Specify the bib file in .tex file 
    \nocite{KEY}                  % Include the reference without citing.
    ```
