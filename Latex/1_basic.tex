  \section{Introduction}
  \paragraph[]{ Latex Information}
  \LaTeX (pronounced "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech") is a \\ markup language built on top of Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting system. 
  It is specifically designed to facilitate the creation of complex documents, especially those that include mathematical 
  formulas and structured content. Unlike traditional word processors, LaTeX separates the content from the formatting, 
  allowing authors to focus on writing rather than design aspects

  \paragraph{First Paragraph}
  Markup languages are systems used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable 
  from the text. They provide a means to structure, format, and present content, allowing for the specification 
  of various elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
