- `Exceptions` are meant to be caught whereas `errors` are not meant to be caught. 
- Errors are clearly documented and you should not try to catch the errors.
- If you are throwing a specific type of exception multiple times then you should 
  create a custom exception class.
- finally block is always executed irrespective of whether the exception is raised or not.
